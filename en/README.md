# **Atlas Framework Documentation**

Welcome to the official documentation for the [Atlas Framework](https://github.com/AtlasFw). Here you will find all the documentation for every function that can be used across all our resources.

## Introduction
After having seen unreadable code, incorrect maintenance of existing frameworks and unexisting semantic versioning, we decided to create a framework that provides the most for creating your own resources with a unique interface for the user. By saying this, we do not confirm that our code practices may be the best; however, when it comes to the user/developer experience, we'll like for you to judge it yourself.

## About
Atlas is an innovative up-coming RPG FiveM framework that plans to provide the best user experience when it comes to developing and roleplaying. Not only do we provide unique interfaces but we also plan to provide one of the most secured frameworks that currently exists.
