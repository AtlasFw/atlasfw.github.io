# Core
The core of Atlas Framework is `atl-core`. It contains all the player methods and functions that are used to interact with the server and player. Not only are they part of the core, but they are also usable in other resources. So what are you waiting for? Start creating your own resources and let Atlas Framework handle the rest.

?> **Important information** - Remember that it is required for you to import `atl-core` in your manifest. Please refer to the [**Import/Export**](../import?id=importing-atlas) section or ask in our discord for more information.
